// Find the largest product of any two numbers within a given array.

// Input: [5, -2, 1, -9, -7, 2, 6]
// Output: 63 (-9 * -7)


//write a function that finds the 2 largest integers and multiply
//while loop
//set largestNumber = array[0]
//set secondLargestNumber = array[0]
//set index = 0
//if array[0] is greater than array[1] then largestNumber = array[0] 
//if array[0] is greater than array[1] and less than largestNumber, then secondlargestNumber = array[0] 
//i++
//return largestNumber * secondLargestNumber



//write a function that finds 2 smallest integers and multiply
//compare the two products.
//if largestIntegerProduct is greater than smallestInegerProduct than outputs the largestInegerProduct.
