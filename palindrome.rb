# Given a string, write a function that returns true if it is a palindrome, and false if it is not. (A palindrome is a word that reads the same both forward and backward.)

# Input: “racecar”
# Output: true

# Input: “baloney”
# Output: false


racecar -> true
repaper -> true
hello -> false

os =   rs =
hello  olleh
os = racecar
rs = racecar 

do it "in place"
it means do this exercise without creating a new database


racecar
i 
      j


raceecar
  i
   j

while i < j
  i++
  j--
  return false if string[i] != string[j]

return true
